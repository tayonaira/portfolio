This is my portfolio. My first of many creations. 
# Portfolio Website

This is a small static portfolio website containing HTML, CSS and JavaScript files to showcase projects, skills and contact information.

## What this project contains

- `index.html` — The main landing page for the portfolio.
- `script.js` — JavaScript for interactive behavior on the site.
- `comment` — (folder or file) contains comments or notes related to the project.
- `doc/` — Documentation or supporting files.
- `*.css` — Stylesheets used by the site:
	- `general.css`, `nav.css`, `form.css`, `skill.css`, `footer.css` and others.


## How to view locally

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser. On Windows you can double-click the file or right-click and choose "Open with".

2. Alternatively, run a simple local HTTP server (recommended for testing features that require a server):

	 - Using Python 3 (if installed):

		 python -m http.server 8000

		 Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

	 - Using Node.js and http-server (if installed):

		 npx http-server -c-1 . 8000

## Development notes

- Keep CSS organized by purpose (layout, components, page-specific) to make maintenance easier.
- Use semantic HTML and add alt text for images for accessibility.
